# iO Academipsum

## Description
iO Academipsum is a React application that uses a custom API (https://github.com/iO-Academy/2022-jan-ipsum-be) to generate our Academy inspired Lorem Ipsum. Great for filling out placeholder text in all your new projects. There are a wide range of phrases ranging from common technologies and phrases used inside the Academy to a few inside jokes that only a select few students/trainers will understand.

Have fun!
